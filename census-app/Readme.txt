This app helps create some unusual visualizations regarding US demographics.
I consider this to be different from the original examples app as it is a 
different visualization prompting and answering different questions. 

The Census 2013 data is plotted which gives as a percentage of population,
1. The number of graduates
2. Number of citizens by birth
3. Number of enlisted veterans
4. Number of unmarried males.

The range of interest over these variables can be compared with the slider.
